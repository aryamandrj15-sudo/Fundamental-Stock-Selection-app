📊 **P/E Ratio (Price to Earnings Ratio)**

The P/E ratio measures how much investors are willing to pay for each unit of earnings.

It is calculated as: Price per Share / Earnings per Share.

A high P/E ratio usually indicates that the stock is expensive or that investors expect high future growth.

A low P/E ratio may suggest undervaluation, but sometimes it can also indicate weak business performance.

It should always be compared with industry or sector P/E for better understanding.

👉 In simple terms: It tells you whether a stock is cheap or expensive.

💰 **ROE (Return on Equity)**

ROE shows how efficiently a company uses shareholders' money to generate profits.

It is calculated as: Net Income / Shareholder Equity.

A higher ROE generally means better management and efficient use of capital.

Companies with ROE above 15–20% are usually considered strong.

Consistently high ROE over years is a sign of a quality business.

👉 In simple terms: It tells how good the company is at making money.

⚖️ **Debt to Equity Ratio**

This ratio shows how much debt a company has compared to its own capital.

A lower ratio (<1) means the company is financially stable.

A higher ratio (>2) indicates higher risk, especially during downturns.

Too much debt can reduce profits due to interest payments.

👉 In simple terms: It tells how risky the company is financially.

📉 **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**

RSI is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis.

It ranges from 0 to 100 and helps identify overbought or oversold conditions.

Above 70 → Overbought (possible correction)

Below 30 → Oversold (possible bounce)

👉 In simple terms: It helps you decide when to buy or sell.

Also check if the stock is reasonably valued.

👉 Buy good companies at fair prices.
